Project Mercury

Make a game with Java ! 

In /src/application is the first version.
Only need to dodge red cubes.
The longer you survive, the higher score you get.
(The aim is to reach 100k score)

In /src/shooter is the verison i'm working on.
I'm tring to make player can shoot bullets and a boss to fight against.
(maybe will not continue making it for a long time)
