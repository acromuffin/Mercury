Project Mercury

Make a game with Java!

In /src/application is the first version. <br />Only need to dodge red cubes. <br />The longer you survive, the higher score you get. <br />(The aim is to reach 100k score)

In /src/shooter is the version I'm working on. <br />I'm trying to make a player can shoot bullets and a boss to fight against. <br />(maybe will not update it for a long time)
